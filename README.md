# Take The Plunge!
This is my submission to the Brackeys Game Jam - Risk It For The Biscuit!  
The game is about a ice diver who has limited oxygen and has to dive deeper to get more valuable objects  
Sell your objects in the shop to get better gear  
And never go too deep...

The repo and unity project has been created! As well as a mood board on Miro has been created to get ideas  
The name 'Take The Plunge' came from different ways to say 'risk it for the biscuit'.  
'Take the plunge' meaning in simple English is 'Finally do something risky or bold'  
so the idea came about to mix the plunge idea of ice diving and the theme idea of risking it.
